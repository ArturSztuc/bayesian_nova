# Amortized Bayesian Inference using NOvA
A small proof of concept + tests for Amortized Bayesian Inference using a bit more complex datasets than what's normally provided in the literature.
Using NOvA MC to train an Amortized model to see if we can train on FHC + RHC, numu + nue data with all osc + systematic parameters (~50 in total).
